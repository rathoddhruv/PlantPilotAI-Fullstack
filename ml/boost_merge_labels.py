# teaching it what NOT to detect. To incorporate these examples, we copy the
# corresponding image into ``merged_images`` and create an **empty** annotation
# file in ``merged_labels``. An empty label file signals that the image contains
# no objects, reinforcing it as a negative sample.

# After merging all sources of data, construct a YAML file that describes the

# point to ``images/train`` so that the model uses the full merged dataset for
# both training and validation. ``names`` maps class indices to class names.

#
# Occasionally annotation files can be malformed (e.g. missing values or
# non-numeric entries). To guard against training crashes, iterate through all
# label files and sanitise them. Any line that does not consist of exactly
# five space-separated numeric values is dropped. If any corrections are made,
# the original file is backed up with a ``.bak`` extension.
