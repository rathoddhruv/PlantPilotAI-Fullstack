what i learn is for this 2 flower D and H, yolov8s is working fine and obj detection with B_box


=============

1. when selct image bounding box in label studeo , add classes and label 
2. export with YOLOv8 OBB with Images
image segmentation
object detection
YOLOv8 OBB format with images downloaded.

3. export directly copy and pase in data\yolo_merged
4. run python convert_to_yolo.py
5. run yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data=yolo_merged.yaml imgsz=960 epochs=50 device=0 cfg=custom_train.yaml
6. detect result with :  DETECT
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train2/weights/best.pt source=data/yolo_merged/images/val imgsz=960 conf=0.2 device=0

7. for refine more with active elarning : run python active_learning_label.py (with some new images, have to set path in config wher these new image is are )
use terminal and review image one by one, yuo can use owen image editor or viewerr by giveing that path 
8 python boost_merge_labels.py
9.
